<p class="largerText descProse fullJustify">My Ph.D. research was conducted at Indiana University in the School of Journalism and Mass Communications. My
dissertation, which has received funding from multiple sources,
examines the relationships among journalists, news sources and
media coverage and the roles each of these play in the construction
of the HIV/AIDS epidemic in Tanzania. I received a B.A. in English
and Print Journalism from North Central College in 2006 and an M.A.
in Communication and Society from University of Oregon in 2008.</p>
<p class="largerText descProse fullJustify">My international and
professional backgrounds complement my teaching interests. During
the past year I proposed and taught two new courses for the School
of Journalism: &ldquo;Muslims and the Media&rdquo; and
&ldquo;Muslims in the News.&rdquo; In the past I have been involved
in teaching journalism survey and skills courses in visual
communication.</p>
<p class="largerText descProse fullJustify">My research focuses on
issues related to health, gender, technology and religion that are
situated within the contexts of global communication, journalism
and media studies. I often employ a multi-method approach in my
work, which has included in-depth interviews, content analyses,
textual analysis and structural equation modeling. My papers have
won awards at conferences and have been published in peer-reviewed
journals.</p>
