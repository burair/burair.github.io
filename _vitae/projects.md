## A Circular Motion Problem Gamified
In the conceptual physics course for beginning physics learners we discuss, experience and observe various examples of objects moving in circular motion. These include planetary motion and water in a bucket swung over head without spilling. This introduces the concept of the apparent (inertial) centrifugal force in a fun way to demonstrate the effects of accelerated motion in a non-inertial frame of reference. As we solve problems we watch videos of motorcycles in circles of death. In our problems we anayze situations, involving level and banked tracks, scaffolded via simulated motion. Below is an embedded version of a simulation I created using the GeoGebra Package.
